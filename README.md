Through the “Introduction to Unity Scripting” Parts 1 and 2 tutorial series by Eric Van de Kerckhove, I developed my first interactive game experience in Unity, a sheep rescue game built around simple yet engaging mechanics.
After completing the core tutorial phase, I implemented several improvements to strengthen the player experience and enhance the sense of engagement, including visual additions such as farm elements to enrich the overall atmosphere.
I added pink sheep that award double points when saved. This change was intended to sustain players’ attention and make the reward mechanism more motivating.


I integrated background music to enrich the emotional atmosphere of the game. The music supports the game’s rhythm and helps players form a stronger emotional connection with in-game actions.


To strengthen the farm environment, I added visual elements such as trees, crops, clouds, and a bright sky to create a more vivid and immersive scene.


Through these enhancements, I aimed to increase the overall appeal of the game while reinforcing both the emotional and behavioral dimensions of user engagement.
